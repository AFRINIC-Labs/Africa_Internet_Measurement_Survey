# Africa_Internet_Measurement_Survey

Recently, AFRINIC Lab conducted an Internet measurement survey aimed at capturing the state of Internet measurement platforms availability, capabilities, and challenges Africa. We received responses that gave us an idea of the popular Internet measurement platforms in Africa as well as the gap that needs to be filled in the area. This page provides access to the survey data as well as works on characterising the different Internet measurement platforms in Africa.

The file survey_analysis.ipynb contains the analysis of the survey with the survey responses presented as results-survey150419.csv file. Other jupyter notebook files presented above present the analysis of the different measurement infrastructure available in the country.
